# DineBook Backend

## Overview
DineBook Backend is a small personal project I developed for restaurant table reservations. Itâ€™s built using **Express.js** and connected to a **MongoDB** database through **Mongoose**. This backend provides APIs for user authentication, table reservations, menu viewing, food reviews, and profile management.

> **Note**: This is the backend part of the application and needs to be used in conjunction with the [dine-book-frontend](https://github.com/supphawit/dine-book-frontend) repository.

## Features
- **Login & Registration API**: Handle user authentication and secure sign-up/sign-in.
- **Table Reservation API**: Manage table bookings for users.
- **Menu API**: View the restaurant's menu. (Maintainance)
- **Food Reviews API**: Add, view, and manage food reviews. (Maintainance)
- **Profile Management API**: View and update user profile information.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend Framework**: Express.js for handling server-side logic.
- **Database**: MongoDB, with Mongoose for object data modeling (ODM).
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication and authorization.
